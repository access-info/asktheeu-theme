According to Regulation 1049/2001 the applicant simply has to make a written request in any form, including electronic form. There is no further requirement to give any personal details nor to state reasons for the request.

Article 6.1 of the Regulation says "Applications for access to a document shall be made in any written form, including electronic form, in one of the languages referred to in Article 314 of the EC Treaty and in a sufficiently precise manner to enable the institution to identify the document. The applicant is not     obliged to state reasons for the application."

At the bottom of this page, write a reply to the authority explaining this to them.
